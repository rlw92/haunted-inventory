INVENTORY APPLICATION - Odin Project

The objective of this task is to create an inventory management app with all
the CRUD principles for users.

I have decided to go with the idea of a haunted inventory.
The app will contain all manner of items with a a spooky story attached to each
of them that users of the site can read or, if they wish, can submit their own items
and stories attached to them.

Each item will have a price and a number in stock attached to it along with the story.

There will be a categories section, e.g small items, large items.

The database will be MongoDB.

The personal objective for me will be to learn how to implement
features I have already learned e.g css React with the express framework
and gain further experience using the framework.

express haunted-inventory --view=pug
DEBUG=haunted-inventory:* npm start
